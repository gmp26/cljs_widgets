# rcljsdemo

This R package collects some examples of htmlwidgets - coded in clojurescript.

## Installing

Note that this is not a production ready package. The intention is to add further examples.

```
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
devtools::install_git("https://github.com/gmp26/cljs_widgets")
```


## Refer to the R package documentation (when it's done!)
